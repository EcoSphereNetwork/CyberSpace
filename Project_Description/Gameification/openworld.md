# OpenWorld 

Below, you’ll find a comprehensive concept for implementing interfaces with other 3D worlds (or "spaces") to make your cyberspace as versatile and expandable as possible. The goal is to ensure that your "Ghost in the Shell"-like 3D environment does not remain isolated but can exchange data, objects, avatars, or scenes with other VR/3D environments and interact seamlessly.

## 1. Overview and Goals

### Interoperability
- Your cyberspace should be capable of importing and exporting 3D models, scene objects, avatars, or network data from and to other 3D environments.  
- For example, users could visit your cyberspace from another 3D "social VR" space (e.g., Neos VR, Mozilla Hubs, etc.), or you could load data from your cyberspace into Unity/Unreal scenes.

### Diverse Data Types
- Beyond simple 3D geometries (e.g., GLTF, OBJ, FBX), network metadata, scan results (Nmap, etc.), or audio/video streams might also be relevant.  
- Interfaces should transmit not only graphics but also event-based information (e.g., "New device detected" or "Malware object in VR space").

### Common Standards
- Use existing formats and protocols wherever possible (e.g., GLTF for 3D assets, X3D, USD, or VR-specific formats) and WebXR APIs for interoperability between browser-based 3D environments.

## 2. Types of Interfaces

### 2.1 File-Based Interfaces (Import/Export)

#### 3D Asset Formats
- Enable the export/import of GLTF or USD (Universal Scene Description). This allows sharing model geometries, materials, and basic animations.  
- For example, avatars or device models used in your cyberspace could be converted into GLTF (or similar) for use in other 3D applications.

#### Scene or Space Exports
- Provide options to save the entire scene (including positions of nodes, markers, devices) in formats like USD or X3D. Other programs could load these scene files.

#### Configuration Files
- If your cyberspace includes specific plugin configs (e.g., whiteboard setups, chat logs, etc.), these could be exported as JSON or XML. Metadata might be partially reusable in other spaces.

---

### 2.2 Real-Time Network Interfaces (APIs)

#### REST/GraphQL API
- For querying or sending data (e.g., "List of all active devices and their coordinates").  
- Other 3D clients could use this API to create simplified 3D representations or send new data back (e.g., "Add this 3D model at coordinate X, Y, Z").

#### WebSocket/Event Streaming
- For real-time collaboration: Other worlds can subscribe to your event system (e.g., "notify me when a new device appears").  
- An external VR space could, for instance, see live updates when a server scan reveals a new object in your cyberspace.

#### WebXR Bridge
- If your system supports WebXR, implement a "portal" technique to allow seamless switching from another WebXR space (e.g., Mozilla Hubs) to your cyberspace via link or "portal object."  
- Conversely, you could place a portal object in your cyberspace leading to an external 3D world.

---

### 2.3 Session Sharing or "Teleports"

#### VRChat/Neos/Altspace-Style Portals
- A conceptual portal that users enter to instantly transition into another 3D world (via the same browser/client or a compatibility bridge).  
- Basic avatar and action synchronization could occur if avatar systems are compatible.

## 3. Technical Implementation: Step-by-Step

### Phase 1: Basics & Format Selection
- **3D Asset Format**  
  Choose GLTF (optionally with USD support) as the standard for internal objects, avatars, and device icons.  
  Create routines (e.g., `importGltf(file)`, `exportGltf(node)`) for loading/saving scene objects.

- **API Design**  
  Define a REST or WebSocket API to fetch objects/nodes (e.g., `/api/objects`, `/api/devices`).  
  Include security mechanisms (OAuth2, token-based authentication) to restrict external access.

- **Basic Compatibility**  
  If you have an existing Mindspace/GlobeScene structure, create a JSON schema for devices, marker coordinates, avatars, etc., so other 3D clients can load and replicate a basic version of your space.

---

### Phase 2: Simple Import/Export Functions
- **Manual Exchange**  
  Provide a UI for "Export Scene" (saves your 3D layout as GLTF, USD, or JSON for metadata).  
  Add an "Import Scene" function to load these files into your cyberspace.

- **Sub-Graph Export**  
  For instance, export a Force-Directed Sub-Graph (e.g., Local Network) as GLTF or JSON for use in Blender or other engines.

- **Compatibility Testing**  
  Test whether standard programs (Blender, Unity, WebXR clients) can at least load base meshes. Effects like bloom or glitch might not carry over, but geometry should.

---

### Phase 3: Real-Time Interfaces
- **Real-Time WebSocket**  
  Add an event system (e.g., `OBJECT_ADDED`, `OBJECT_UPDATED`, `OBJECT_REMOVED`) for synchronized data updates. External 3D viewers can display parallel scenes.

- **Portal Object**  
  Create a "PortalToXYZ" object in your cyberspace that redirects users to an external VR space (e.g., Hubs) when clicked.  
  Similarly, allow external VR spaces to place portals linked to your cyberspace's API/URL.

- **Avatar Sync**  
  Define a protocol (position, rotation, avatar name) to enable avatars from one world to appear in another. Technically challenging but feasible with shared metadata and codecs.

---

### Phase 4: Collaboration with Other 3D Worlds
- **Custom Bridges**  
  Develop plugins for specific VR ecosystems (e.g., Unity-based VRChat or Neos VR) to exchange data with your backend or display your space in their clients.

- **Standardization**  
  Work within a network of VR/AR spaces to agree on shared protocols (e.g., JSON over WebSocket) for synchronizing avatars, objects, and events.

- **Permissions & Auth**  
  Implement a role/token system to control access to private Mindspace data.

---

### Phase 5: Long-Term Vision
- **Federated Cyberspace**  
  Your environment becomes one node in a larger network of 3D spaces, linked via standardized portals to form a metaverse-like system where users can move between worlds, carry avatars, and share objects.

- **Advanced Features**  
  Shared cloud avatars, global inventories (objects/tools), unified chat/voice channels, and perhaps a shared economy or token system (metaverse concepts).

- **Collaborative Scenarios**  
  For example, open a whiteboard in your cyberspace that others from different 3D apps can view and edit in real time.  
  Alternatively, design mission/quest mechanics where users from external VR worlds debug malware incidents or network issues in your cyberspace.

## 4. Challenges and Tips

### Complexity
- Bridging different 3D engines, formats, and network protocols requires thorough testing.  
- Start with minimal functionality: basic asset import/export and simple position/state synchronization.

### Security
- Sharing tools (e.g., Kali-Linux plugins) or network data may expose sensitive information.  
- Ensure only authorized VR spaces/users can access APIs and encrypt private data.

### Performance
- Synchronizing many objects in real-time can cause lag. Implement level-of-detail and filtering mechanisms.

### Physics/UI Differences
- Each VR platform has unique physics and UI systems. Full-scene physics synchronization may not be feasible.

## Summary
To implement interfaces with other 3D worlds/spaces and maximize your cyberspace's versatility:

- **Basics:** File-based import/export (e.g., GLTF, USD) for 3D assets, scenes, and metadata.
- **Real-Time API:** REST/WebSocket for dynamic object, event, and avatar exchanges.
- **Portals:** Create links between your cyberspace and external VR/AR worlds.
- **Plugins:** Build bridge plugins for further integration with Unity/Unreal/Neos VR/VRChat.
- **Security:** Maintain role and permission systems to protect private data.
- **Collaboration:** Enable avatar synchronization, shared chat channels, and whiteboard editing.

This creates a connected, metaverse-like system where your cyberspace becomes part of a broader VR/AR/3D ecosystem—diverse and interoperable.
